# Hello, I'm Kaleb Hingsberger! 👋

A **Software Engineer** and **AI Specialist** (B.S. Computer Science '25) focused on building intelligent, secure, and scalable cloud systems.

My passion lies at the intersection of **AI/Machine Learning, Backend Development, and Application Security.** I bring hands-on experience from an **AI Engineering Internship** at Appgate, where I architected data pipelines for **Neo4j knowledge graphs** and led R&D in **GraphRAG** and **LLM** querying.

* 🌱 I'm always learning and currently deepening my skills in generative AI, cloud-native security, and distributed systems.
* 🚀 I am actively seeking full-time **Software Engineer** or **AI/ML Engineer** opportunities.
